Some utility applications I made to streamline generating SDKs using UE4SS and UE4ProjectGenerator:

UE4ProjectGeneratorAutomator gives the [commandlet](https://github.com/Archengius/UE4GameProjectGenerator) a GUI, and will generate batchfiles so the process need not be repeated (still requires building the uproject beforehand)
